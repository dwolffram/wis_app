# wis_app

This repository contains an R Shiny app to visualize forecasts and forecast scores for the COVID19 Forecast Hub (to be run locally). The app requires the repository `covid19-forecast-hub` available at https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub to be available. For the paths to work out it should be stored in the same directory as `wis_app`, otherwise the variable `path_hub` in `server.R` needs to be adapted accordingly.

The folder `Rnw` contains an Rnw file to generate a PDF report for a given team.
